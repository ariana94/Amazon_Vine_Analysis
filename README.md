# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Short Overview
In this project I took a dataset on amazon video game reviews and ran an analysis to see if there were biased 5-star ratings from vine members.

## The Results

- How many Vine reviews vs non-Vine reviews were there?
  - There were 94 total Vine member reviews and 40,471 total non-Vine member reviews.
  
- How many Vine/non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  - 48/94 Vine member reviews and 15,663/40,471 non-Vine member reviews were 5-stars.
 
- What percentage of Vine/non-Vine reviews were 5-stars?
  - 51% of Vine member and 39% non-Vine member reviews were 5-stars.

## Summary

If we look at our analysis, we can see that Vine members had over 50% of their reviews as 5-stars where non-Vine members had les than 40% of reviews as 5-stars.
This shows a fairly large margin of biased 5-star reviews. Additionally, we could look into lower-starred reviews to see if it matches that trend.

If we look at the 4-star reviews, it follows a very similar pattern with almost 10% of difference. 

The trend also continues with 3-stars. This confirms our hypothesis about Vine members having biased reviews.
